Sales Analysis on Superstore Data

 
A superstore has given us the task to identify what works best for them in terms of sales and making profit. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) we will help them identify:
1. Their most and least profitable product categories
2. Segment analysis of sales and profit
4. Given the insights gained from the EDA, the superstore can choose to remove non-profitable products or invest in marketing efforts for products, segments and geographical areas that are driving their profit
